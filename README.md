This repository contains multiple directories (projects) to experiemnt with C++.
Code is not of high quality: most is only partly thought through; 
some is designed to fail and see what goes wrong;
some of it might be interesting.

Some projects produce executables which crash or have source files which do not compile.

    ./buildAndRunAllProjects 

cleans, builds and runs projects in turn

    ./newProject <ProjectName> 

will create a new project with Makefile, source file and git additions made.
