This repository contains multiple directories (projects) to experiment with C++.
Code is not of high quality: most is only partly thought through; 
some is designed to fail and see what goes wrong;
some of it might be interesting.

To create a new project with Makefile, source file and git additions made, run:

    ./newProject <ProjectName>
